    <h1>Welcome to Daniel’s Website Hosting Guide</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Daniel Brown</strong>. I'm 13 years old, and I’m excited to teach you how to host your very own website — for free!</p>

    <p>I built this site to help beginners like you learn how to get your website online without spending money. When I first started coding, I had so many questions and couldn’t find help that made sense. So I decided to make it easier for others.</p>

    <p>Why trust me? Because I’m just like you — a student who loves tech and wants to build awesome stuff. I’ve used GitHub Pages and Cloudflare to launch sites, and I’ll show you every step.</p>

    <p>Let’s get started on your journey to becoming a website owner. No complicated words. No paid tools. Just fun, learning, and free hosting!</p>

    <p>If you're 13 like me, or any age, you can start building today.</p>
    <p>All you need is curiosity and a little time.</p>
    <p>I used free tools and simple HTML to make this.</p>
    <p>By the time you're done, you'll know how to publish your own site.</p>
    <p>It’s not magic. It’s just a little bit of code and the right tools.</p>
